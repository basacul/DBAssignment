# Goal of the Project

The main purpose of this project consists in building a database from the data set american-election-tweet.xlsx/.csv such that the following constraints are fulfilled:

  1. Which tweets were the most important?  
  
  2. Which hashtags were used the most?  
  
  3. When did the most hashtags occur?  
  
  4. Wich hashtags frequently occur together?  
  
  5. How has the frequency of special hashtags developed over time?
  
To sum up, the database allows to query for specific information about hashtags and its correlations.
